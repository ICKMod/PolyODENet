Intelligent catalysis kinetics knowledge distillation project using ODENet and beyond.

The initial effort will focus on deriving chemical rate equations from concentration time-series data based on the law of mass action. The following tools/principles are used.

1. Neural ODE solver by Ricky T.Q. Chen et al. (https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq)

2. Symbolic regression

3. Sparse regression
